Github tutorial

This is an attempt to learn about Github.  
This is completely new to me and I hope that this will help me get organized.
I hope to move my PowerShell scripts to Github so that I can keep track of them.
Many of my scripts are incomplete and this may help me organize them and remind me where I left off.

Thank you Github!

Charlie
